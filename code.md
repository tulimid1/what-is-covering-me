Code can all be found [here](https://github.com/tulimid1/what-is-covering-me/tree/main). 

To recreate figures and analyses from paper, follow these steps:

1. Download the main branch of the [repo](https://github.com/tulimid1/what-is-covering-me/tree/main).
2. Create a new Pyhton environment using `conda`.

`conda env create -n <env-name> -f <env-yml-file>.yml`

3. Run X, Y, Z notebooks to replicate figures and analysis.  

We recommend downloading a zip file of the repository, unzipping, creating a new environment based on the .yml file, adn then running the notebooks to replicate figures.
